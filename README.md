# SDK-Analysis
Step by step walk through for APK analysis for beginners
The attached powerpoint is aimed at interested students and scholars who are interested in pursuing questions of datafication within the mobile ecosystem, regardless of their technical capacity. This file is based on a workshop that took participants to ground zero of personal data generation: your mobile phone. It provides an atomic-level view of the third party SDKs (software development kits) that render our data into the raw material for data capitalism. It does so by examining both the mobile permissions that give access to the data on our devices and the SDKs embedded in the applications.

This workshop was created by the AHRC-funded ‘Zones of Data Translation’ project, which yieded this database of 5000 android apps: <a> https://manifestdestiny.reveb.la/</a>
